        <b class="edi-tab-title">Create Layouts and Maps</b>
        <li>Create the application layout (normally – proprietary flat-file, CSV, XML or JSON layout) so that {{ site.title }} can validate, analyze and generate business application message.</li>
        <li>Create the partner layout (normally – X12, EDIFACT, XML or JSON layout) as agreed upon with the trading partner so that {{ site.title }} can validate, analyze and generate business partner message.</li>
        <li>Create maps correlating the data in the application layout and partner layout, so that {{ site.title }} can perform the appropriate conversion (mapping) between the application and partner message formats.</li>
        <li>{{ site.title }} is packed with smart and innovative features, which significantly simplifies your EDI Implementation &amp; WEB SERVICES Integration effort. At the time of layout creation, syntax validation rules are automatically built-into the layout. Test Data Generator will rapidly generate sample data for testing. Analyzer will validate your layouts while Simulator will validate your maps.</li>

        <li>The Implementation kit is a very innovative feature in {{ site.title }}, used for packaging your data integration implementations (trading partner agreements and associated layouts, maps, workflow, etc.) for deployment from development system to production system, and also to remotely support the implementation in production.

        <li>Configure your end points (ftp, web services, etc.), various servers like scheduler, sender(s), receiver(s), listener, functional acknowledgement, etc. to send and receive messages between your business application and your trading partners in an unattended mode. Create rules for identifying the layout to be associated for analyzing the file based on text in the data file or file naming convention. The run time map execution engine (translation) in form of Windows Service (background process) uses the implementations (agreements) prepared by {{ site.title }} designer tools (layouts, maps, trading partner agreement, workflow) to perform the data validation, mapping and integration.</li>
        <li>{{ site.title }}’s multithreaded architecture significantly boosts its performance. Its Alert and Notification feature warns you of translation failures via email. It comprehensively logs all interactions for audit and monitoring.</li>
