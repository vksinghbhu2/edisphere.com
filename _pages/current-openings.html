    <h1 class="edi-content-subtitle">Our Development Platform</h1>
    <p class="edi-content-paragraph">Our current development platform comprises of VS 2015 IDE / Visual C++ (majorly) / Visual C#, MS SQL Server database, ASP.NET MVC, Flex++/Bison++ (for context free grammar), on Windows 2012+ on premise and Azure cloud platform. The product source code is checked in VSTS with continuous build, release and deployment setup under process. The product deployment platform is both on premise windows servers and Azure instance (in both license model and pay-per- use model). The product is a data integration platform with single-instance multi-tenant SaaS architecture, for seamlessly integrating ERP systems and Cloud systems of the trading partner community in both traditional EDI integration (X12, EDIFACT, etc.) and modern REST API web services integration in XML / JSON. The idea is to now use Azure PaaS for releasing the product as a data integration platform on cloud and also offering our own vertical services. The monolithic and multithreaded architecture of the product is being re-designed to use Azure Platform Services and use of Service Bus (pubsub queue) in a micro service like architecture. We need very committed and smart people for design and development of this work. There is lot of work on both the server / backend side and the UI side.</p>
