    EDISPHERE Software launched India’s first indigenous Cloud offering at ANY-TO-ANY.COM, for integrating Businesses, Government, Public Sector Units (PSUs), and Multinational Companies (MNCs) in India, in a low-cost, self-service, pay-per-use model, with the initial capacity of handling over one million transactions per day.<br><br>
    It is a Beta offering, which is free till March 2015. The initial customers will also get very attractive post-Beta pricing as gesture towards their participation in championing the product.<br><br>
    "The businesses in India are ready for affordable data integration solution. We are only limited by number of hands that can do the data integration", says, Ajay Sanghi, Founder and Managing Director of EDISPHERE Software. “ANY-TO-ANY.COM is expected to see exponential rise in its customer base once the system integrators using the self-service component to integrate businesses reaches a threshold”, says, Sanghi.<br><br>
